# SafeLink Continuous Learning System

## 🎯 Overview

The **Continuous Learning System** enables your SafeLink deployment to automatically improve its detection capabilities by learning from new attacks in production. This implements **reinforcement learning** where the ANN model trains itself on real-world traffic data collected from all users.

### Key Features

✅ **Non-Blocking Training**: Model learns in background while detecting threats  
✅ **Automatic Data Labeling**: Uses DFA detections and high-confidence ANN predictions  
✅ **Incremental Learning**: Updates model without catastrophic forgetting  
✅ **Model Versioning**: Automatic backups and rollback capability  
✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks accuracy, loss, and training metrics  
✅ **Multi-User Data**: Aggregates attack patterns from all deployments  
✅ **Production Safe**: Validates model before deployment

### Data Flow

1. **Collection Phase**:
   - System monitors database for new alerts
   - Collects alerts since last training cycle
   - Minimum threshold: 100 new samples

2. **Labeling Phase**:
   - **DFA Detections** → Label: Attack (confidence: 100%)
   - **ANN High Confidence (>95%)** → Label: Attack
   - **ANN Low Confidence (<30%)** → Label: Benign (false positive)
   - **Unknown/Medium Confidence** → Skip

3. **Training Phase**:
   - Extract features from alert metadata
   - Create mini-batches (32 samples)
   - Incremental training (3 epochs, low LR)
   - Non-blocking background thread

4. **Validation Phase**:
   - Check accuracy > 70%
   - Check loss < 2.0
   - Compare with previous performance
   - Automatic rollback if validation fails

5. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Save updated model
   - Create backup of old model
   - Record metrics and version
   - Model auto-reloads in detector

## 📊 How It Works

### Automatic Data Labeling

The system uses a **smart labeling strategy** to create training data without manual annotation:

```python
Label Strategy:
├─ DFA Detections (Rule-based)
│  └─ Label = 1 (Attack) 
│     Reason: DFA uses deterministic rules, 100% confidence
│
├─ ANN Detections with Confidence > 95%
│  └─ Label = 1 (Attack)
│     Reason: High confidence predictions are reliable
│
├─ ANN Detections with Confidence < 30%
│  └─ Label = 0 (Benign)
│     Reason: Likely false positives, treat as normal traffic
│
└─ Medium Confidence (30-95%)
   └─ Skip
      Reason: Uncertain, wait for more data or manual review
```

### Incremental Learning Process

Unlike traditional training that starts from scratch, continuous learning uses **incremental updates**:

**Traditional Training:**
```
Train on 100,000 samples → Deploy model → Fixed forever
```

**Continuous Learning:**
```
Deploy base model
  ↓
Collect 100 new attacks → Train (small update) → Validate → Deploy
  ↓
Collect 150 more attacks → Train (small update) → Validate → Deploy
  ↓
... continues forever ...
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001 (vs 0.001 for full training)
- **Epochs**: 3 (vs 50+ for full training)
- **Batch Size**: 32 (small batches)
- **Frequency**: Every hour if enough data

This prevents **catastrophic forgetting** where the model forgets old patterns while learning new ones.

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Startup

Continuous learning starts automatically when you start the packet sniffer:

```bash
# Start backend
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000

# Start sniffer via API or UI
POST /sniffer/start
```

The system will:
1. Initialize ANN detector
2. Start continuous learning background thread
3. Begin monitoring for new alerts
4. Train every hour (configurable)

### Manual Control

#### Check Status
```bash
GET /learning/status

Response:
{
  "enabled": true,
  "is_training": false,
  "last_training_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "last_processed_id": 1543,
  "total_training_cycles": 12,
  "model_versions": 12
}
```

#### Trigger Manual Training
```bash
POST /learning/train-now

Response:
{
  "message": "Training cycle started",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

#### View Training History
```bash
GET /learning/history?limit=10

Response:
{
  "total_cycles": 12,
  "history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
      "training_time": 5.2,
      "num_samples": 142,
      "metrics": {
        "loss": 0.234,
        "accuracy": 94.2,
        "samples": 142
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Start/Stop Learning
```bash
# Stop continuous learning
POST /learning/stop

# Restart continuous learning
POST /learning/start
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Default Settings

Located in `core/continuous_learner.py`:

```python
learning_interval = 3600      # Train every 1 hour
min_samples = 100             # Need 100 new alerts before training
batch_size = 32               # Training batch size
learning_rate = 0.0001        # Low LR for incremental learning
max_history = 10000           # Keep last 10,000 alerts
```

### Customization

Edit these values when initializing:

```python
from core.continuous_learner import ContinuousLearner

learner = ContinuousLearner(
    ann_detector=detector,
    learning_interval=1800,    # Train every 30 minutes
    min_samples=50,            # Lower threshold
    batch_size=64,             # Larger batches
    learning_rate=0.00005,     # Even lower LR
    max_history=20000          # More history
)
```

### Production Recommendations

**For High-Traffic Deployments** (1000+ alerts/day):
```python
learning_interval = 1800       # Train every 30 min
min_samples = 200              # More samples per cycle
batch_size = 64                # Larger batches
```

**For Low-Traffic Deployments** (< 100 alerts/day):
```python
learning_interval = 7200       # Train every 2 hours
min_samples = 50               # Lower threshold
batch_size = 16                # Smaller batches
```

**For Mass Deployment** (collecting from 1000s of users):
```python
learning_interval = 3600       # Every hour
min_samples = 500              # Need significant data
batch_size = 128               # Large batches
learning_rate = 0.0002         # Can increase LR slightly
```

## 📈 Multi-User Data Aggregation

### Scenario: 10,000 Users Worldwide

Your SafeLink deployment collects attack data from thousands of users:

```
User 1 (USA) → Detects: SSH brute force → Database
User 2 (Europe) → Detects: ARP spoofing → Database
User 3 (Asia) → Detects: Port scan → Database
...
User 10,000 → Detects: DDoS attempt → Database
                                        ↓
                        Continuous Learning System
                                        ↓
                    Aggregates all attack patterns
                                        ↓
                    Trains model on global data
                                        ↓
                Updated model deployed to ALL users
```

**Benefits:**
- User A encounters new attack → Model learns
- Updated model pushed to Users B, C, D, ...Z
- Everyone benefits from collective intelligence
- Model becomes more robust over time

### Privacy Considerations

The system only stores:
- IP addresses (can be anonymized)
- MAC addresses (can be hashed)
- Attack patterns (statistical features)
- No personal data or packet payloads

**GDPR Compliance:**
```python
# Anonymize IP addresses before training
def anonymize_ip(ip):
    # Keep network portion, anonymize host
    return ".".join(ip.split(".")[:3]) + ".0"
```

## 🔒 Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Model Validation

Before deploying updated model:
```python
Validation Checks:
✓ Accuracy > 70% on new data
✓ Loss < 2.0
✓ No catastrophic performance drop
✗ If any check fails → Rollback
```

### 2. Automatic Backup

Every training cycle:
```
Current model → backup_20240115_103000.pt
Train → Test → Pass? → Deploy
                 Fail? → Restore from backup
```

### 3. Version Control

All model versions tracked:
```json
{
  "model_versions": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
      "metrics": {"accuracy": 94.2, "loss": 0.234},
      "model_path": "models/ann_model.pt"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Non-Blocking Execution

```
Main Thread:           Background Thread:
├─ Packet Sniffer      ├─ Continuous Learner
├─ ANN Detection       ├─ Wait 1 hour
├─ Alert Generation    ├─ Collect new data
├─ WebSocket Updates   ├─ Train model
└─ API Endpoints       ├─ Validate
                       └─ Deploy (hot reload)

❌ No blocking!
✅ Users see no downtime
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Feature Extraction (TODO)

Currently, the system uses placeholder features. For production, implement:

```python
def extract_features_from_alert(alert: Alert) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Extract features matching original training data.
    
    Required features (example):
    1. Source IP (numeric)
    2. Destination IP (numeric)
    3. Source MAC (numeric hash)
    4. Packet size
    5. Protocol type
    6. Port numbers
    7. Flow statistics
    ... (78 features total)
    """
    # TODO: Implement real feature extraction
    # Option 1: Store raw packet data with alerts
    # Option 2: Store pre-computed features
    # Option 3: Reconstruct from IP/MAC/metadata
    
    pass
```

**Recommendation:**
Add a `features` column to Alert table:
```python
class Alert(Base):
    # ... existing columns ...
    features = Column(JSON)  # Store feature vector
```

Then store features during detection:
```python
alert = Alert(
    module="ANN",
    reason=reason,
    src_ip=src_ip,
    src_mac=src_mac,
    features=feature_vector.tolist()  # Store for later training
)
```

### Model Hot Reload

The system automatically reloads the model after training:

```python
# In ANNDetector class
def load_model(self):
    """Reload model from disk"""
    self.model.load_state_dict(torch.load(self.model_path))
    self.model.eval()
```

For hot reload without restart:
```python
# After training completes
continuous_learner._save_model_version(metrics)
ann_detector.load_model()  # Reload updated weights
```

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Enable Continuous Learning

Already enabled automatically! Just start the sniffer:

```bash
# Via API
POST /sniffer/start

# Via UI
Dashboard → Sniffer → Start
```

### Step 2: Monitor Initial Training

Check status after 1 hour:
```bash
GET /learning/status
```

Expected first cycle:
- Collects 100+ alerts
- Trains in 5-10 seconds
- Accuracy: 80-95%

### Step 3: Configure for Your Traffic

Adjust based on your alert volume:

```python
# In continuous_learner.py or via API configuration
learning_interval = 3600  # Adjust based on traffic
min_samples = 100         # Lower for low-traffic environments
```

### Step 4: Set Up Monitoring

Add to your monitoring dashboard:
- Learning status endpoint
- Training cycle count
- Model accuracy trend
- Failure alerts

### Step 5: Backup Strategy

Automatic backups created at:
```
models/backups/model_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pt
```

Recommended: Copy to external storage daily:
```bash
# Cron job
0 2 * * * cp -r /path/to/models/backups /backup/location
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Continuous learning not starting

**Check:**
```bash
GET /learning/status
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Start sniffer first
POST /sniffer/start

# Manually start if needed
POST /learning/start
```

### Issue: No training cycles occurring

**Check:**
- Alert count: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM alerts WHERE id > last_processed_id`
- Minimum samples: Default 100
- Time interval: Default 1 hour

**Solution:**
- Lower `min_samples` threshold
- Manually trigger: `POST /learning/train-now`
- Generate test alerts

### Issue: Model accuracy decreasing

**Check training history:**
```bash
GET /learning/history
```

**Possible causes:**
- Bad labels (false positives/negatives)
- Catastrophic forgetting
- Learning rate too high

**Solution:**
- Reduce learning rate
- Increase validation threshold
- Manual review of recent alerts

### Issue: Training taking too long

**Check:**
- Number of samples
- Batch size
- Hardware (GPU vs CPU)

**Solution:**
```python
# Reduce batch size
batch_size = 16  # Instead of 32

# Or increase interval
learning_interval = 7200  # Train less frequently
```

## 📚 Advanced Topics

### Distributed Learning

For massive deployments, implement federated learning:

```python
# Central server aggregates models from edge devices
# Each user's model trains locally
# Only model updates (not data) sent to server
# Privacy-preserving collaborative learning
```

### Active Learning

Request labels for uncertain predictions:

```python
# Flag medium-confidence alerts for review
if 0.3 < confidence < 0.7:
    alert.needs_review = True
    
# Admin reviews and provides label
# High-quality labeled data for training
```

### Transfer Learning

Use pre-trained models for new deployments:

```python
# New user starts with global model
# Fine-tune on local traffic
# Faster convergence, better initial performance
```
